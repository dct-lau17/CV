## Skills

#### Communication

Throughout my career I have often had to communicate to technical and non-technical stakeholders. This was demonstrated through translating ideas and requirements to developers, writing user stories, tests and specifications, user testing with customers and liaising with business stakeholders to capture requirements.


#### Product Management

I was gained experience in working in a start-up environments practicing agile development and larger organisations adopting a mixture of waterfall and agile methodologies.

Whilst working at FoodIt ltd we saw a need for a point of sale app that runs on android and iOS tablets. I have successfully taken the business idea to an MVP product as well as iterating existing product offerings according to customer feedback. This required working with a lot of project stakeholders to understand, prioritise build a product that users need.

I was able to exercise this skill in group projects during my short time at Makers Academy.

#### Teamwork and Leadership

I have experience in working in a diverse team of developers(in-house and offshore), designers, customer success and product managers.

During my short time running Seely & Lau, I had the responsibility for running a small team of developers and designers to deliver the requirements set out by clients.

#### Fast and Independent Learner

I pick up new ideas and concepts relatively quickly by reading up and asking a lot of questions.

This was also demonstrated in my first job as a product manager in ASQPOS ltd. The business saw a demand for a Point of Sale system that took online orders from restaurant clients. I was tasked in taking this concept into reality with no prior project/ product management and software development knowledge. I overcame this by asking more experienced team members, reading up and talking to customers frequently. The result of the steep learning curve was a workable MVP product that was used by real customers and a hunger to learn more about technology.

The skill was furthered when I took the step to start a partnership business where I had to pick up new business skills and knowledge in a short space of time.
